          J. G. Ballard's 1974 novel Concrete Island culminates in a scene of
          writing. Speeding along the M4 outside London, architect Robert
          Maitland crashes his Jaguar through a guardrail and into a vast
          triangle of waste ground beneath an intersection of overpasses,
          finding himself injured and unable to climb the steep embankments to
          rescue. As night falls he manages to ignite the engine of the mangled
          Jag with the car's. cigarette lighter, but the brief, intense blaze
          fails to halt the rush of traffic overhead. Left to sleep in the
          charred hulk of the automobile, Maitland awakens to notice a retaining
          wall across the island: "The rain-washed concrete shone brightly in
          the sunlight like an empty noticeboard. A message scrawled across it
          in three-feet-high letters would be legible to drivers on the
          motorway."' Desperately in need of writing instruments, he harvests
          the blackened, burnt rubber terminals from the engine's distributor
          caps, using them to mark out "in wavering letters" on the concrete:
          "HELP INJURED DRIVER CALL POLICE." Soon, storm clouds gather and it
          begins to pour, and Maitland is forced to take cover, fashioning a
          crude shelter in the crumbling remnants of a basement doorway. Bruised
          and feverish, he gazes down:
        </p>
        <h3>
          A small printing shop had once been here, and a few copper-backed
          letterpress blocks lay around his feet. Maitland picked one up and
          examined the cloudy figures of a dark-suited man and a white-haired
          woman. As he listened to the rain he thought of his parents' divorce;
          the uncertainties of this period, when he was eight years old, seemed
          to be replicated in the negative image on the letterpress plate, in
          the reverse tones of this unknown man andwoman.
        </h3>

        <p>
          It is a brief, reflective moment, and when Maitland emerges following
          the storm he notices that the letters of his handscrawled message have
          been "reduced to black smudges." Delirious with fever, he finds that
          "the rounded smears were exactly those.of a wind.: shield wiper," and
          wonders: "Was he still trapped inside his car? Was the entire island
          an extension of .the-Jaguar, its windshield and windows transformed by
          his delirium into these embankments? Perhaps the windshield wipers had
          jammed ... and were tracing some incoherent message on the steaming
          glass."
        </p>

        <p>
          This scene of writing and erasure, interrupted by the interlude in the
          basement print shop, traces the contours of western typographic
          historyfrom the marks made by the human hand and the mechanical
          reproduction of text and image made possible by the printing press, to
          a vision of an automated, machinic writing that exceeds both human
          agency and comprehension. So too, the contraction of the island in
          Maitland's mind to the space of the crashed Jaguar is mirrored by its
          expansion in Ballard's narrative to encompass the recent history of
          Great Britain: as he explores the overgrown rubble Maitland discovers
          the remains of a churchyard, Edwardian houses, an air-raid shelter,
          and a postwar cinema. Similarly, the shattered body of the Jaguar
          echoes Maitland's own, just as the inhabitants he soon encounters__.:
          a. r adical hippie dropout named Jane Sheppard and a brutish former
          acrobat known only as Proctor-double his riven psyche. The scene
          itself is doubled, too, when Maitland attempts to trick a reluctant
          Proctor into spelling out a rescue message on the retaining wall under
          the pretense of teaching him to-write his own name: "Already the
          wavering letters of his first alphabet had become strong and
          wellformed. Using both hands he struck at the concrete slope, slashing
          his A's and X's side by side." Maitland traces out words for Proctor
          to copy, but soon enthusiasm gets the best of him and he begins to mix
          up the letters "into an indecipherable mass," eventually rubbing out
          the message and refusing to go on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure of Maitland's writing lesson, read off against the earlier
          episode in the ruins of the printshop, foregrounds what remains
          "uncertain" and "indecipherable" in the mechanization of human
          language. For, the writing lesson is the lynchpin of all western
          typography. Beginning in the fifteenth century, humanist handwriting,
          secured through a pedagogy of imitation and a disciplining of the
          body, transformed the hand into a writing machine. 5 While lowercase
          roman letters emerged from this prosthetic pen-inhand imitating the
          "litterae antiquae" of Carolingian man~scripts, capitals traced their
          origins to the letters engraved on classical roman monuments, the work
          of stone carvers wielding the simple machines of hammer and chisel.
          Geoffroy Tory's 1529 Champ Fleury was one of a number of Renaissance
          treatises that. subsequently sought to delineate the proportions of
          the ideal Roman capital "according to the human body and face," thus
          submitting both typography and the body to the logic of geometry and
          the instrumentality of the grid, compass, and rule. With the invention
          of the printing press the humanist's bicameral script was further
          adapted to mechanical reproduction through the cutting of punches and
          the casting of molds, a process that largely remained unchanged until
          the end of the nineteenth century, giving rise to the digitized roman
          fonts we use today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In what follows I thus want to use Ballard's narrative to reflect on
          one of the more curious episodes in recent typographic history- the
          controversy surrounding the creation of Times New Roman, perhaps the
          most ubiquitous of all typefaces. So the story goes, in 1929 an
          advertising request by The Times of London prompted a tirade against
          the paper's outdated typography by Stanley Morison, imminent British
          typographer, type historian, and advisor to the Monotype Corporation,
          leading to his appointment as "typographical advisor" to William
          LintsSmith, the manager of The Times.6 A series of trials followed in
          which sample pages of the paper were set in a variety of existing
          faces, but Morison was dissatisfied and decided that a new, supremely
          legible, economical, modern, and decidedly English typeface was
          needed. A special committee was convened, and at a meeting on January
          28, 1931, two approaches were approved: a thickened version of Eric
          Gill's Perpetua, and a "modernized Plantin."
        </p>
        <img src="stanley.png" alt="Stanley Morrison portrait" />
        <p>
          Focusing his energies on this second option, according to Morison he
          "excogitated" the design of Times New Roman, "pencilled the original
          set of drawings, and handed them to Victor Lardent, a draughtsman in
          the publicity department of Printing House Square [ where The Times
          was located] whom he considered capable of producing an unusually firm
          and lean lihe." 7 It was from these finished drawings that the final
          metal punches, in both text and titling sizes, were cut by Monotype
          after a large numlier of revisions and refinements. In the interim the
          matter of the change of the paper's masthead to an all~caps roman was
          resolved, and thus, on October 3, 1932, Times New Roman debuted in the
          pages of The Times to universal acclaim. Released for general use the
          following year, it has become in subsequent decades one of the most
          recognizable typefaces of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with Morison's death in 1967 his biographers almost
          immediately began to identify inconsistencies in the official account
          of his role in the design of Times New Roman. 8 Although he could
          render hand-drawn "comps" for the creation of layouts, Morison was not
          a draftsman, 'and it was unlikely that he had "pencilled" the forms
          and given them to Lardent to redraw. Later, in Printing The Times
          (1954), Morison recounted a decision "to modify the normal Plan tin,"
          suggesting that existing metal types had been used as a starting
          point. When questioned in January 1968 Victor Lardent was unable to
          recall specifics, but did tell biographer James Moran unequivocally
          that Morison had not given him any drawings, but instead had "handed
          him a photographic copy of a page from a book printed by Plantin to
          use as a basis."
        </p>
        <p>
          The precise nature of this "photographic copy" has subsequently become
          the source of considerable speculation. Was it merely a type specimen
          of Monotype Plantin? Or perhaps it was a photographic reproduction of
          a much older, original page of Robert Granjon's Gros Cicero type,
          first cut in the sixteenth century, or a later impression of it, as
          typographer Walter Tracy has argued? 10 Measurements from the first
          metal types for Times New Roman bear a close mathematical resemblance
          to those for Monotype Plantin, and the speed with which the initial
          designs were completed would suggest some form of preexisting model,
          since Renaissance print samples provide only rough outlines to work
          from, requiring considerable, time-consuming refinement and recasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, this ur-form of Times New Roman-and who was really responsible
          for ithas remained elusive, and Morison's own remarks in a 1937 letter
          to the American type p.istorian D. B. Updike only served to cloud the
          issue: "It is my one effort at designing a fount. I wish it could be
          redesigned, but it seems to be doing its job day by day in The Times.
          It has the merit of looking as if it had not been designed by anyone
          in particular." Who designed Times New Roman, then? Morison himself
          does not seem entirely sure, and the doublings that trouble the
          accounts of its creation would seem to require a lost original of
          uncertain agency, a “photographic copy” whose adaptation would appear
          to be designed by no one in particular. Indeed, Tracy, in his summary
          assessment of Times New Roman concludes that its “chief defect” lies
          in that it “lacks the insignia of true creation,” precisely what
          Morison finds to recommend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward to 1994, when the question of the origin of Times New
          Roman gained new traction thanks to Mike Parker, a former director at
          Linotype and co-founder of Bitstream, one of the first digital type
          foundries. In his article “W. Starling Burgess: Type Designer?” in the
          journal Printing History Parker made the radical suggestion that the
          original drawings for the font were in fact created in the early 1900s
          by the American yacht designer, aviation pioneer, and engineer William
          Starling Burgess.14 Parker described the “discovery of an ancient set
          of pattern letters” among “the remnants of the Lanston Monotype
          Machine Company of Philadelphia,” which had been purchased by the
          Canadian printer and typographer Gerald Giampa, and documentation
          tying the designs, designated Series 54, to Burgess.
        </p>
        <img src="willianm.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Although Giampa, citing a vague “bond of confidentiality,” had
          withdrawn access to the archive, Parker explained that he had
          uncovered evidence to corroborate a rumor that had circulated in the
          “drawing office at Mergenthaler Linotype in the 1960s and ’70s” that
          “Times Roman had been designed by a naval architect in Philadelphia
          who had committed suicide.”15 What followed was a highly detailed set
          of speculations relying heavily on Burgess’s biography and second-hand
          information suggesting that in 1904 Burgess had drawn and commissioned
          Series 54 from Lanston Monotype, the American counterpart to the
          British Monotype Corporation for use by his design firm. Although work
          on the face had already begun, Burgess, in Parker’s account, was soon
          distracted by a new-found interest in aviation and, following a 1918
          fire in his Boston offices, found himself unable to pay for the
          completion of the project, and Series 54 was shelved.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Parker, in 1923 Lanston then attempted to sell Series 54
          to a fledgling Time magazine under the name Time 54, even going so far
          as to create a trial setting and masthead design, but its development
          was also never completed. And so it only remained for the drawings and
          pattern letters to make their way, in 1931, from Philadelphia to the
          Monotype Works in Salfords outside London and into the hands of
          Stanley Morison, then out of his depth and struggling with the design
          of a “modernized Plantin” for The Times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parker provides neither reproductions of the original drawings he
          claims to have seen, nor any independent evidence. Instead, he relies
          on an elaborate set of formal comparisons using digitized versions of
          Monotype Plantin, Lanston Series 54, the Lardent drawings, and
          Monotype Times New Roman alongside photographs of what he claims are
          original brass Lanston pattern letters, a capital “B” and lowercase
          “f” stamped twice in their lower left corners with the numerals 54 and
          362, Monotype’s series numbers for both Lanston 54 and Times New
          Roman. It was a bold claim, made on the scantest of evidence, which
          occasioned a reply in the pages of Printing History by four respected
          figures in the field: attorney and printer Harold Berliner, Morison
          biographer Nicolas Barker, type designer Jim Rimmer, and president of
          the Printing Historical Society John Dreyfus.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a measured, if rather blistering, rebuttal the four respondents
          dismantled Parker’s argument, sweeping aside its fog of irrelevant
          details, remaining careful to avoid attributing “dubious motives” to
          Parker himself. Berliner finds no trace of the “bond of
          confidentiality” that Giampa cited as the reason for his withdrawal of
          the archive, nor any drawings marked Series 54 in the Lanston holdings
          at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barker, in turn, questions Parker’s appeal to digitized versions of
          typefaces and, after close scrutiny of the test setting of Time 54 and
          the trial Time masthead reproduced in Parker’s essay, shows that
          neither could have been produced as early as he claims. Reviewing the
          accepted prehistory of Times New Roman and citing extant memos from
          the Monotype type drawing office in 1931, Barker concludes that the
          “photographic copy” handed to Lardent by Morison must have been an
          image of a later printing of Granjon’s Gros Cicero type, likely Max
          Roose’s Index Characterum Architypographiae of 1905.17 The proof, he
          argues, is the appearance of the lowercase “a” in the final design, a
          remnant of the substitution of an “a” from another font when Granjon’s
          original types were acquired by the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp
          and used to print Roose’s Index, which then served as the model for
          Times New Roman.
        </p>
        <img src="specimens.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Perhaps most damning, Barker further suggests that the photographs of
          the double-stamped pattern letters in fact depict patterns for Times
          New Roman from 1961, onto which the numerals “54” had been added after
          the fact.19 Rimmer, quoted at length in a letter to Dreyfus, reveals
          that the fragmentary “Burgess Italic” that Parker also reproduced in
          his essay was in fact drawn by him at Giampa’s request to accompany a
          1993 revival of Time 54, for which a “cloudy outline” and digital
          files were supplied. Moreover, Rimmer states that Giampa had also
          given him a set of punches identical to the “54” that appears on the
          doublestamped pattern letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          One might assume that these detailed counterarguments would have
          finally put Parker’s claims to rest, but to the end of his life he
          never wavered. Instead, he proceeded to develop Giampa’s “Burgess”
          into a full-fledged typeface in six weights, renamed Starling, which
          was commercially released in 2009. To accompany the release Parker’s
          tale regarding the “true” origin of Times New Roman was largely taken
          as fact, and a number of press outlets picked up the story, including
          the Financial Times. 20 With Parker’s death in 2014 his theory
          circulated once again, and today, no less an authority than Wikipedia
          includes a mention of Burgess in its entry on Times New Roman.21
          Nevertheless, a comprehensive biography of Burgess published in 2015
          cites no “reference whatever in extant Burgess letters, notebooks,
          autobiographical writings, or in his surviving library to typography
          or to the art and craft of type design.” “Nor, finally,” the author
          adds, “was Burgess, despite taking basic courses in mechanical drawing
          at Harvard, a proficient draftsman.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So the question remains, who designed Times New Roman? Parker, a
          typographic expert and respected industry veteran, could hardly be
          described as a crank or a dupe. Giampa, meanwhile, who died in 2009,
          is a shadowy figure whose motives remain obscure—financial gain?
          character assassination? legitimate historical recovery? As recounted
          in the Financial Times, a 2000 flood destroyed any remaining evidence
          in the Lanston Monotype archive that Giampa had purchased, and
          supposed original documents reviewed by Parker in the Smithsonian in
          1996 are reportedly contaminated and no longer accessible. A 1941 bomb
          blast near Monotype’s London offices had also destroyed many of the
          original records concerning Morison’s work on Times New Roman.23
          Still, surely an authority like Parker must have seem something that
          convinced him, and the persistence of the Burgess story and its
          grudging acceptance within design history points, at the very least,
          to an unresolved need to come to terms with its creation. This detour
          into the gentlemanly world of typographic controversy is traversed by
          a complex series of doublings that locate the development of Times New
          Roman firmly within the “body machine complex” of the early twentieth
          century.24 Naval architect, aviation pioneer, and later co-designer of
          the Dymaxion car with Buckminster Fuller, Burgess doubles Morison,
          authority on the mechanization of typography and a railroad enthusiast
          who rode on the footplate of a Gresley A1 Pacific locomotive all the
          way to Edinburgh and enthusiastically attended the departure of the
          high-speed Flying Scotsman on its first non-stop trip along the London
          and North Eastern Railway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like J. G. Ballard’s Maitland behind the wheel of his Jaguar, both
          were men whose “intimacy with machines” is of a piece with a culture
          of locomotion in which agency is uncertain, and the human body, no
          less than the type body, is submitted to new disciplinary regimes—the
          timetable, machine work, and the grid—that are shadowed by the spectre
          of the automaton. In fact, in a promotional pamphlet published by The
          Times in conjunction with the debut of the new redesign of the paper
          Morison explained that the need for the new typeface was a respose to
          the dramatic changes in reading habits occasioned by the acceleration
          of human transport:
        </p>
        <h3>
          It is evident that there must be changes in typography as long as our
          social habits are open to variation. When it was founded, The Times
          was largely read in coffeehouses; in the nineteenth century it came to
          be read in trains; to-day it is largely read in cars and airliners.
          Reading habits, dependent on social habits, will not remain constant.
          Neither must newspaper typography remain constant.

          Who better, then, to have designed Times New Roman than an
          architect-engineer and future car designer? Or perhaps “Burgess” might
          simply stand for the uncertainties that obtain in the collision of
          bodies and technologies whose contours the writing scenes in Ballard’s
          Concrete Island circumscribe, and which lie at the very heart of
          typographic history, from the humanist pen and the printing press
          straight through to the TextEdit software that this essay is being
          written in—the “no one in particular” whose authorship Morison takes
          as “the chief merit” of Times New Roman. By way of conclusion this
          question of agency suggests one more doubling, and a silence that thus
          far marks a glaring absence from any account of Stanley Morison: the
          figure of Beatrice Warde

          Former librarian for ATC, the American Type Founders Company, and
          ex-wife of Frederic Warde, director of printing at Princeton
          University, Beatrice Warde joined the Monotype Corporation in London
          in 1927 as editor of its house journal, The Monotype Recorder, and was
          soon promoted to head of publicity, a position she held until her
          retirement in 1960. Warde’s initial appointment had come thanks to an
          article she had written for the typographic journal that Morison
          edited, The Fleuron, in which she had unraveled the question of the
          origins of the typeface Garamond, having tracked down the original
          sixteenthcentury punches in Europe. It was an impressive piece of
          typographic detective work, published by Warde anonymously under the
          pseudonym Paul Beaujon. Monotype, it was said, had been shocked when a
          woman arrived to take the job.

        <p>
          Warde and Morison would become lifelong friends and close colleagues,
          and it was to her that he sent a cable announcing the committee’s
          approval of the decision to change the masthead of The Times, the
          final element in the paper’s conversion to Times New Roman: “DIRECTORS
          AND ALL EDITORIAL EMINENTISSIMI UNANIMOUS ROMAN HEADING.”29 Morison,
          who famously disdained the use of first names, addressed his letters
          to Warde at this time “Dear P,” and it was thus as Paul Beaujon—a male
          moniker that seems to have been something between an open secret, an
          inside joke, and a mark of respect—that Beatrice Warde came to join
          the fraternity of men who led the typographic renaissance that began
          after World War I, although she was still unable to attend meetings of
          the Double Crown Club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warde’s other great contribution to the theory of typography is the
          essay “The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should be Invisible,” first
          delivered as a lecture in 1930 and still read by every undergraduate
          design student, in which she advocates for the transparent quality of
          good typography. The essay could easily serve as a brief for Times New
          Roman, now so commonplace that one contemporary commentator has stated
          that, “To look at Times New Roman is to gaze into the void.”

          Recalling the “negative image” of the “unknown man and woman” that
          occasions Robert Maitland’s reverie in the ruined printshop in
          Concrete Island, it is tempting to imagine what Beatrice Warde’s role
          in the development of Times New Roman might have been, and the status
          of the still-elusive “photographic copy” that Lardent claims to have
          been handed by Morison. As an accomplished type scholar and researcher
          Warde most certainly knew her way around an archive, and as an
          American and former librarian at ATC she had industry connections in
          the States. Her ex-husband, Frederic, we know, attended the Lanston
          Monotype School in Philadelphia to learn how to work the machinery.31
          As a publicist at Monotype, Warde would also, no doubt, have had
          regular dealings with the publicity department at The Times, and could
          have recommended Victor Lardent—whose primary occupation was the
          drafting of advertisements—for his “unusually firm and lean line."
          Could “Paul Beaujon” —that doubly-gendered vanishing mediator —have
          been the source of the “photographic copy” that served as the model
          for Times New Roman? That, we cannot know. After all, invisibility,
          Warde insisted, is the sign of good typography, just as every type
          designer knows that the spaces between letters —the counterforms — are
          just as important as the marks on the page. So too, the questions and
          doublings that persist around the design of Times New Roman point to
          the collision of bodies and technologies that shape the development of
          modern letterforms—and the lapses and failures that attend them.

          In his writing, Owens explores the complicated history of Times New
          Roman and Compares it to the events of JG Ballard's story 'Concrete
          island'. In this story, the main character is stuck in a waste ground
          beneath an intersection of an overpass, in his disparity, he attempts
          to use blackened rubber terminals from his car to write an SOS sign.
          Alas, his efforts are wasted because the rain soon washes it away.
          Throughout the story, he makes similar attempts to no avail. The story
          investigates marks made by human hands, the technological production
          of print and image through the printing press and a vision (as it is
          only a thought of panic in the story) of automated machine writing or
          as we now call it, computing. Owens points out the parallels of this
          evolutionary complexity, relating it to the story of Times New Roman.
          An important quote that I discovered in this reading and that I feel
          summarizes what he is trying to elude to is "To look at Times New
          Roman is to gaze into the void". Because there is so much to decipher
          and speculate in its history, why bother worrying about who gets the
          credit for sketching it, photographing it etc, when even now in the
          21st century, we have recorded and are studying the names of the
          people who were in any way shape and form related to it. As Beatrice
          Ward says, 'Printing should be invisible', just as the rain washed
          away Maitland's sign for help, history has taken away the certainty of
          creation and originality is questioned. That being said, I feel that
          it is important to acknowledge the individuals who we know worked hard
          behind the scenes to aid the technical production of typefaces like
          Times New Roman, such as the women in the Monotype Type Drawing
          Office.

          The first known example of faux-Hanzi was called ‘Mandarin’. It was
          designed by Henry H. Thorp for the Cleveland type foundry in 1883. We
          can assume this then gave way and became the blueprint for all
          faux-Hanzi fonts to come thereafter. The typefaces in this category
          intentionally ignore the writing rules of Hanzi because they simply
          cannot replicate the intricate style of Hanzi going left to right, top
          to bottom as well as the order in which each of the strokes are
          written. Unlike English where the strokes can be written in any order,
          Hanzi has an order that dictates the style of each eight fundamental
          strokes which informs the overall character, which cannot be
          replicated in the Latin version of the faux Hanzi fonts. Moreover,
          there are no circular shapes in Hanzi making the circular shapes in
          the Latin version such as O, B, C and D, look stiff and awkward.
          You’ve probably seen Faux-Hanzi fonts in commercial places like
          Chinatown on takeout boxes and plastic bags since they were widely
          used by Chinese immigrants to help them thrive commercially. However,
          historically they have also been used on posters and products that
          mocked and discriminated against the Asian population, especially in
          the USA when it was used as fear-mongering propaganda.

          The creation of 'Mandarin' coincidentally reminds me of the most
          recent novel I read (skimmed through) which is 'Severance' by Ling Ma.
          In the book, the protagonist, Candace Chen, who is a first-generation
          Chinese immigrant, is living in a dystopic New York City taken over by
          a deadly virus called Shen fever. At the beginning of the book,
          Candace is eluded to have a nostalgic attachment to 1980s-style
          American consumer capitalism which seems to "obscure" her awareness of
          how she herself is implicated in processes of capitalist exploitation
          and gentrification. I am referring to one scene in particular where
          she is watching Woody Allen's 1975 film "Manhattan" which showcases
          New York in a highly romanticized fashion, instead of looking at the
          New York outside her apartment window. Such instances remind me of
          Karl Marx's idea of a "false consciousness" created by the media to
          distract us from our exploitive realities. I feel that this scene
          relates to 'Mandarin' because of this very reason. As something that
          was once created by white people to mock and satirize the intricate
          beauty of actual Mandarin typography; 'Mandarins' use in the media
          that had directed it toward Asian people made it an almost concrete
          connotation to the Asian American dream and entrepreneurial heritage,
          through its sad reclamation by small Asian businesses who wanted to
          appeal to the white masses in order propel their (usually food)
          businesses and seem authentic to them.
